# Jellyflix

A Jellyfin client for **Android TV / Google TV** focused on two things the
official clients leave on the table:

1. **Playback that feels native.** Tunneled MediaCodec decoding, display
   refresh-rate matching (goodbye 24 fps judder), real Atmos / DTS passthrough,
   and a device profile built from the codec list the TV actually reports —
   not a generic Android fallback that transcodes when it shouldn't.
2. **Real plugin support on the TV itself.** Third parties can ship APKs that
   add home rows, subtitle providers, scrobblers, and playback hooks. Plugins
   load in-process via `DexClassLoader` but are scoped by a declared
   permission list the user approves the first time a plugin is enabled.

> Status: **scaffold**. The project builds a working skeleton — server connect,
> login, home, library grid, ExoPlayer playback, plugin loader — and the core
> optimisations are wired up. Details screen, settings, Quick Connect, 4K HDR
> track preferences, and the in-app plugin store are the next milestones.

## Build

```bash
# One-off: generate the Gradle wrapper jar. (We don't commit the .jar so
# the repo stays text-only; the wrapper script + properties are in place.)
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.9

./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :sample-plugin:assembleDebug
```

Open the repo in **Android Studio Panda 4 (2025.3.4)** or newer. When prompted,
install the Android TV 14 (API 34) system image if you want to run the emulator.

## Install on a TV

1. Enable ADB debugging on the TV (Settings → Device Preferences → About →
   build number ×7, then Developer options → ADB debugging).
2. Pair: `adb connect <tv-ip>:5555`.
3. Deploy: `./gradlew :app:installDebug`.
4. Install the sample plugin the same way: `./gradlew :sample-plugin:installDebug`.
   It will show up on next app launch.

## Differentiators (what makes "optimized" real)

These are the things a Jellyfin client on a TV tends to get subtly wrong; the
scaffold wires each up in `playback/`:

- **Tunneled decoder path** (`PlaybackOptimizer.renderers`) — MediaCodec
  hands frames directly to the display pipeline, skipping a GPU compositor
  hop. Cuts 40–100 ms of latency and CPU load.
- **Refresh rate matching** (`PlaybackOptimizer.matchRefreshRate`) — on frame
  rate detection we reconfigure the window to the closest supported mode
  (23.976 → 23.976, 25 → 50, 59.94 → 59.94). No 3:2 pulldown judder.
- **Real device profile** (`StreamUrlResolver.buildDeviceProfile`) — the
  server-side direct-play decision is made from `MediaCodecList`, not from
  a one-size profile. HEVC 10-bit, AV1, EAC3 JOC, TrueHD Atmos all get
  declared when the decoder supports them.
- **Audio passthrough + offload** — `DefaultRenderersFactory` is built with
  offload + float output + passthrough enabled. Atmos and DTS:X bit-perfect
  when the panel/receiver exposes it.
- **MediaSession service** — the Now-Playing card in the launcher shows the
  current episode; Assistant remotes can pause/seek without re-opening the app.
